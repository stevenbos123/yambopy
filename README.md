yambopy
=======

Create automatic workflows for yambo and quantum espresso using python. Work directly with netCDF databases.
Do pre/post-processing, data analysis and plotting for yambo and quantum espresso.

Documentation
-------------

The main usage of yambopy is by importing its modules in the user's own scripts, such as:
```
from yambopy import *
from qepy import *
```
There is also a command line interface feature. Just type
```
yambopy 
```
on terminal to see the options. Typing `yambopy [option]` will show the related help message.

You can find explained tutorials and a partial 
documentation on the Yambo wiki page: https://wiki.yambo-code.eu/index.php/First_steps_in_Yambopy

The tutorials contain examples scripts illustrating how to use some of the features: they are intended to be copied, modified and adapted to other use cases and to your ideas and needs. 

Additional information about capabilities and usage are available inside the tutorial folder and by reading the docstrings of the various classes. Keep in mind that a basic knowledge of python (`numpy` and `matplotlib` packages) will greatly help while using yambopy. 

Features
--------
- Create Yambo and Quantum Espresso input files from python
- Collect and manipulate the human-readable output data for analysis
- Automatic submissions of calculations (e.g., custom workflows for convergence or multi-executable runs)
- Access Yambo netCDF databases and Quantum Espresso xml files
- Analyse, interpolate and plot the results in various ways using matplotlib
- Visualize advanced quantities such as:
  -  dielectric function, exciton weights in k and q-space, electron-phonon matrix elements...
- [Aiida](https://github.com/aiidateam) plugin for Yambo-Aiida workflows 
- Tutorials

Installation
------------

Make sure that you have a suitable python environment (created for example with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

Use python version >=3.10.

If you never used an environment just type
`python -m venv MYPATH/yamboenv/`       (you can replace `MYPATH` with any path you prefer, e.g. `~/`)
`source MYPATH/yamboenv/bin/activate`   (for bash users, you can add to your .bashrt the line `. MYPATH/yamboenv/bin/activate`)

#### Regular installation of released version
Type `pip install yambopy`

#### Local installation from this repository (for latest patches)
Clone this repository in your local machine or cluster, enter the directory and type `pip install .`
 
#### More information
Follow the installation steps on the [Yambo wiki](https://wiki.yambo-code.eu/index.php/First_steps_in_Yambopy).
